In addition to this, it's important to calculate your current __net worth__. Your net worth is the total monetary value of all your possessions, minus any liabilities such as loans.

```
Net worth = (Total assets - Total liabilities)
Example:
Net worth =
(House Value + Car Value + Bank Balance + Investments + Super)
-
(Credit Cards + Mortgage Outstanding + Student Loan)
```

I encourage you to start a spreadsheet to track this number throughout your journey.
