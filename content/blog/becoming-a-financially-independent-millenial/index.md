This is a blog about money. Particularly about money for millennials.

We have got a bad rap for being too liberal with our money, unable to afford homes because we buy too much smashed avo on toast. It's true we live in a vastly different economic climate than our parents did. Home prices have increased dramatically more than incomes. There are also so many more ways to waste your money than there was fifty years ago (as we'll see).

However blaming the economy is all just excuses, so I want to show you many ways that you can be smarter with your hard earned cash. I'm don't want to preach to you boring shit like "do a spreadsheet" or "put your change in a jar", because I think the we've moved on from that.

Instead, I want to show you what they don't teach in schools. Things your parents maybe didn't tell you. Things maybe someone has said but it didn't actually sink in.

Why should you care about your finances? It's true that money can't buy happiness, but it can buy freedom. Freedom to do whatever you want, when you want, unshackled from the corporate culture and banks who will stop at nothing to squeeze every last cent from you.

My ultimate goal is to steer you on a path to financial independence. This means building a life where the quality of your experiences is not dependent on your income. Many people choose to retire earlier than expected, though that's not the end goal here. It absolutely is possible to reach this point on a middle class income if you're smart with your spending and you invest the difference.

For now, it's important to figure out where you sit currently, so most likely you will fit into one of these brackets:

1. I'm financially independent, whether I work or not has no impact on my lifestyle.
2. I'm working full-time, have no car loans or credit cards, I'm paying off my mortgage or investing and on the path to financial independence.
3. I'm working full-time, have a car loan or credit card, I'm saving for a deposit on a house but not making much progress.
4. As above but I'm not always meeting my regular payments. Getting charged interest and late fees.
5. The world is imploding around me. Heavily in debt and struggling with basic living expenses.

Think about where you fit right now on this spectrum. No matter where you are, that's OK. Personal finance is your own race, so you can't compare your situation with others and think you're too far behind to bother and may as well keep chugging along as you are. There's no better time than now to begin your journey. So let's get started.
