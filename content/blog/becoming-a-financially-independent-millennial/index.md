The future of this blog is going to talk about the many ways to help speed up the time required to becoming financially independent. However it's important to start with the absolute basics. The math behind becoming financially independent is surprisingly simple!

The number one figure that matters is this:

*Your percentage rate of savings of your take-home pay*

The percentage rate of your savings is pretty easy to work out.

*Your income minus how much you need to live*

The thing is, even if your income is very high, if you are spending 90-100% of it per paycheck then you will never be financially independent. You will always be tied to that paycheck until you can reach into your superannuation (or 401k in the USA).

On the other hand, if you spend nothing you can stop working right now.

That's pretty unrealistic so lets consider some alternatives in the middle.
If you can put away 20% of your income in investments earning an average 7% return per annum, it'll take you 30 years to reach financial independence. That's still a pretty long time. However if you can boost that up to 60-70% it will take you 10 years or less.

What?! I hear you say. How on earth could I put away 60-70% of my income right now? Well, not right now. It would take some significant life changes for most people to reach this saving percentage immediately. Instead of trying to do this tomorrow, I challenge you to set a savings percentage just a little higher than what you do currently. Make one small life change like cutting out Uber Eats, and save that difference.

What kind of difference can that make? Well if you take an average Uber Eats order for two of $45 every week, that's $2340 a year. But it's not just that cost, it's the opportunity cost of not investing that. Thanks to the magic of compound interest, saving that amount over 30 years is worth **$238,851** to you. Yep. That's nuts.
